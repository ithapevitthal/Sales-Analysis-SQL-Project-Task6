# Sales-Analysis-SQL-Project-Task6
# 🛒 Sales Data Analysis with MySQL

This repository contains SQL scripts used to clean, transform, and analyze a retail sales dataset using MySQL Workbench. The project demonstrates essential data preparation techniques and aggregation logic to support business insights and dashboarding.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `rename_columns.sql` – Renames columns to more usable formats for analysis and visualization.
- `table_rename.sql` – Renames the original table to a cleaner, standardized name.
- `profit_aggregation.sql` – Aggregates profit by city, year, and month using `GROUP BY` and `SUM()`.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- `ALTER TABLE` with `CHANGE` for column renaming
- Data type adjustments for date and string handling
- `RENAME TABLE` for standardizing table names
- `GROUP BY` with `SUM()` and `YEAR()`/`MONTH()` functions for time-based analysis
- Error handling and iterative debugging in MySQL Workbench

## 📊 Sample Insight

The final query reveals monthly profit trends by city, enabling deeper understanding of regional performance over time. This can be directly integrated into Power BI or other visualization tools for interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.sql` files in MySQL Workbench.
3. Execute scripts in order: table rename → column rename → aggregation.
4. View results in the result grid or export for dashboarding.
